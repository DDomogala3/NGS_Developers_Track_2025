This program is part of an exercise from the "Practical Programming" intro to programming book published in 2012. 
It takes a DNA sequence as input and counts the bases and lists it in the GUI. 
It uses TKinter to take user input and display the base count when the button is entered. 

Future versions will take a *TRUNCATED* FASTA file as input and count the number of bases, or count groups of sequences.
